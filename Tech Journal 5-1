How did you connect to a router?
We connected to a router by hooking up with an ethernet cable and configuring the IP addresses cia CLI. 
enable, configure terminal, interface ______, ip address xxx.xxx.x.x 255.255.255.0.
Make sure computers are on proper gateways. 

Sniffer prevent traffic from flowing, unsure how to fix. 
Furthest right on routers and switches is frequently 0/0 and going left increases by one.
